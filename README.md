# Ship Performance

This repository contains the source code and resources used to develop machine learning models for Borna's MSc thesis on vessel fuel consumption prediction. It is structured to support the thesis by providing access to all relevant modeling and preprocessing workflows.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for building and training the machine learning models.
- **`notebooks/pipeline/`**: Includes the preprocessing notebook used for preparing the fuel oil consumption datasets.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document and share the methodology and tools utilized in the thesis, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the results.



pip install -r requirements.txt for necessary packages.
